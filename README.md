# Awesome Vulnerability Research [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## ü¶Ñ A curated list of the awesome resources about the Vulnerability Research

> First things first:
> There are no exploits in this project. `Vulnerabilities != Exploits` A Vulnerability resides in the software itself, doing nothing on its own. If you are really curious about then you‚Äôll find **your own way** to discover a flow, this list aimed to help you **find it faster**.

Maintained by [Sergey Pronin](https://github.com/sergey-pronin) with contributions from the [community](https://github.com/securitychampions).

Vulnerability Research is the process of analyzing a product, protocol, or algorithm - or set of related products - to find, understand or exploit one or more vulnerabilities. Vulnerability research can but does not always involve reverse engineering, code review, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing and debugging.

## Purpose

Currently, there is **way more** insecure code out there than researchers. Much more people looking at code that‚Äôs deployed in the real world are required by the market. This project exists to share a different awesome sources of information with you and encourage more people to get involved. Here you will find books and articles, online classes, recommended tools, write-ups, methodologies and tutorials, people to follow, and more cool stuff about Vulnerability Research and tinkering with application execution flow in general.

## Contributing

This List is published according to the *"Done is better than Perfect"* approach, so your contributions and suggestions are very valuable and are always welcome! There are two options:
1. Use the standard method of forking this repo, making your changes and [doing a pull request](https://github.com/securitychampions/Awesome-Vulnerability-Research/pulls) to have your content added. Please check the [Contributing Guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
2. Occasionally, if you just want to copy/paste your content, I'll take that too! [Create an "Issue"](https://github.com/securitychampions/Awesome-Vulnerability-Research/issues) with your suggestions and I will add it for you.
